What is IT Service Management?

IT Service Management (ITSM) is a set of process-based practices that help organisations design, deliver, manage, and improve IT services to meet their business needs and provide value to their customers. 

ITSM can involve:

- Aligning IT services with the organisation's goals and objectives
- Implementing best practices to manage IT services throughout their lifecycle.
- Continually improving IT service quality, efficiency, and effectiveness. 

ITSM frameworks like ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) provide guidance on how to implement ITSM practices, including service strategy, design, transition, operation, and continual service improvement. 


The ultimate goal of ITSM is to ensure that IT services support the organisation's business goals and deliver maximum value to customers.


The 4 Elements of ITSM

Over time, 4 key areas have been recognised as integral to implementing quality ITSM:
- People
- Processes
- Technology
- Partners


People
The people involved in the delivery and support of IT services, including customers, users, and IT staff.

Processes
The structured set of activities and workflows that define how IT services are delivered and managed, such as incident management, problem management, and change management.

Technology
The tools, systems, and applications that support the delivery and management of IT services, such as service desk software, monitoring tools, and automation solutions.

Partners
The external suppliers, vendors, and other third-party organizations that provide services or support to the IT service provider, such as cloud service providers or hardware manufacturers.


IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)

ITIL [IT Infrastructure Library] is a set of best practices for ITSM that provides guidance on how to plan, design, deliver, and improve IT services. It helps organisations align their IT services with business needs, improve service quality, and optimize service delivery processes. 

How does ITIL Fit into ITSM?

Many of you will undertake an ITIL v3 or V4 course during your career. It is essential to understand how the two work together. 

Your ITSM should be configured to utilise this framework and the lessons learned. For example, when a ticket is completed, mark the ticket as resolved and then allow your customer to respond before the ticket is closed, as a ticket should never be reopened once closed but resolved back to Open is still valid.


Summary

ITSM stands for Information Technology Service Management. It is a set of best practices, processes, and policies that are designed to manage and deliver IT services to customers. 

ITSM focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business and ensuring the delivery of high-quality services that are efficient, effective, and cost-effective.

ITSM encompasses various frameworks and methodologies such as ITIL, COBIT, and ISO/IEC 20000.
