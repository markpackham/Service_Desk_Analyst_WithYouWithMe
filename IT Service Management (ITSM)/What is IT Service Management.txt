What is IT Service Management?

IT Service Management (ITSM) is a set of process-based practices that help organisations design, deliver, manage, and improve IT services to meet their business needs and provide value to their customers. 

ITSM can involve:

- Aligning IT services with the organisation's goals and objectives
- Implementing best practices to manage IT services throughout their lifecycle.
- Continually improving IT service quality, efficiency, and effectiveness. 

ITSM frameworks like ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) provide guidance on how to implement ITSM practices, including service strategy, design, transition, operation, and continual service improvement. 


The ultimate goal of ITSM is to ensure that IT services support the organisation's business goals and deliver maximum value to customers.


The 4 Elements of ITSM

Over time, 4 key areas have been recognised as integral to implementing quality ITSM:
- People
- Processes
- Technology
- Partners


People
The people involved in the delivery and support of IT services, including customers, users, and IT staff.

Processes
The structured set of activities and workflows that define how IT services are delivered and managed, such as incident management, problem management, and change management.

Technology
The tools, systems, and applications that support the delivery and management of IT services, such as service desk software, monitoring tools, and automation solutions.

Partners
The external suppliers, vendors, and other third-party organizations that provide services or support to the IT service provider, such as cloud service providers or hardware manufacturers.
