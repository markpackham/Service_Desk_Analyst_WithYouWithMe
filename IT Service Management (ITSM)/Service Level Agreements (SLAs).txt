Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

IT Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are contracts that define the level of service expected between an IT service provider and its clients.

They outline the agreed-upon metrics, responsibilities, and expectations for the IT services provided, including availability, performance, and response time. 


Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are the service desk's expectations on handling their tickets. Multiple types of SLAs can exist based on the ticket but also the department as a whole.

These expectations are set to allow a minimum level of service that the company can rely on for multiple sections of the ticketing process. SLAs will also keep an IT department accountable for ensuring they hold a high service level at all times.
