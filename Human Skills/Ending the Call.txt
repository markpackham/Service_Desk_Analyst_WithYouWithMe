Ending the Call


Transitioning to the closure of the call

In your interactions with your customers, once you have finished troubleshooting, you will proceed to close off the call with the customer. 

This process can be tricky for some but doesn't need to be. All you need to remember is you are having a conversation with your customer and you would handle the transition the same way as you were wrapping up a conversation with a friend or family member.


Resolved Issue
You would want to consider using this when you have resolved the issue to provide the user a run through what you did to resolve their issue.

Unresolved but providing steps
Consider using this kind of transition when you aren't able to provide a resolution but are providing them steps to perform to move towards a resolution.

Unable to provide resolution
This should be your least used transition but this still remains professional and gives your customer clear understanding of why you are unable to resolve their issue.


Closing the call

When you have either resolved the issue or have provided the next steps for the customer to follow on their own, how you choose to close the call 


Summary
Closing an IT Support phone call typically involves summarizing the solution or steps taken to resolve the issue that the customer was facing, ensuring that the customer understands and is satisfied with the solution, and thanking them for contacting the IT Support team.

The IT Support representative may also offer additional assistance or resources if needed and ask the customer if they have any further questions or concerns before ending the call. Finally, the representative will end the call by saying goodbye and providing any necessary follow-up information, such as a ticket number or reference number for the customer's records.
