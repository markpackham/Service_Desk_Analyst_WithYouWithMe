Using Mute and Hold



The 'Hold' Function

The hold function is used on phone calls to temporarily mute or pause the conversation while the caller is put on hold. 

By using hold, a service desk analyst can temporarily pause a call or chat conversation while working on a task or obtaining information.

When to use HOLD
Using hold can be an effective tool for managing the conversation and ensuring that a smooth call flow occurs. 

Some best practices to keep in mind when considering the hold function:

- Using hold should be avoided unless it is required for a specific purpose during the call
- The misuse of hold can potentially raise the frustration levels of a customer
- Overusing hold can cause a customer to feel that their issue isn't important to you and that theyâ€™re second to whatever it is that you're trying to do
Any time you use the hold function, it is best practice to explain why you are doing so to the customer.


The use of "Are you there?" when returning to a call can come across as unprofessional.
Instead, try:
"Thank you for your patience, <Name>".


Example: Placing a Customer on Hold
The following is an example of good technique when placing a customer on hold:

Customer:
"Hi, I have a question about my bill. Can you help me?"

Customer Service Representative:
"Of course, I'd be happy to help. Can you please hold for a moment while I review your account?"

Customer:
"Sure, no problem."

(Customer Service Representative places the customer on hold for a few moments while they access the customer's account information)



Example: Taking a Customer off Hold
The following is an example of good technique when returning to a call and taking the customer off hold: 

Customer Service Representative:
"Thank you for holding. I have reviewed your account and it looks like there is a discrepancy in your billing. I will need to consult with our billing department to resolve this. Can I place you on hold for just a few more moments while I speak with them?"

Customer:
"Yes, please go ahead."

(Customer Service Representative places the customer on hold again while they consult with the billing department)

Customer Service Representative:
"Thank you for holding. I have spoken with our billing department and we have identified the issue. I will now explain the solution and we can work on resolving this for you. Thank you for your patience."



The 'Mute' Function

The mute function on a phone call temporarily disables the microphone so the other person can't hear you. It is typically used when you need privacy or to block background noise. 

A service desk analyst may utilise the mute function during a phone call with a customer to temporarily disable their microphone and talk to a colleague or research a solution without interrupting the call. This can help improve the quality of service and reduce customer wait times.

When to use MUTE
A service desk analyst can use the mute function when they need to do the following actions:

- Consult with colleagues
- Research a solution
- Address a situation without interrupting the customer
- Clear your throat or cough
- Take a drink
It should be used sparingly and with proper communication to avoid leaving the customer confused or neglected. 



Best Practices: Using Mute
Let's say a service desk analyst is on a call with a customer and needs to mute themselves to consult with a colleague to resolve the issue. The analyst should follow these steps:

Inform the customer that they need to mute the line briefly to consult with a colleague to resolve the issue
Press the mute button on their phone or headset to ensure that the customer cannot hear their conversation with the colleague
Consult with the colleague to resolve the issue as quickly and efficiently as possible

- Avoid the use of "Are you there?" when you return
- Use the customers name as much as possible
- Set realistic expectations on how long you anticipate the hold to be.
- When you reach the end of the hold time, go back to the customer with an answer / request for more time. Don't leave them on a single hold indefinitely.
