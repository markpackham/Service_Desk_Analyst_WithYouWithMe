Opening the Call

Opening a call is the initial greeting or introduction a caller makes at the beginning of a phone conversation. It sets the tone for the rest of the call and establishes a connection with the person on the other end of the line. 

A strong opening can help ensure a productive and positive conversation as it's your first contact with your customer.


Best Practices When Opening a Call

The open to the call should always ensure that you are providing the following items

- Thanking the caller for their call.
- Your Name.
- The Business Name that you are answering for.
- Asking how you can help or for other information.
Some businesses require you to take identifiable information (Name, Serial Number, etc.), which can take the place of the last point in the list.


To ensure that you are providing the best service to your customer, you should always open your call with as much information to reduce any potential confusion to the customer that is calling the Service Desk. So not just your name but the company you represent.
